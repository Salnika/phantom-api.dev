Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

     1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
        the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
        non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
        exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

        a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in
           part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material, in whole or
           in part, for NonCommercial purposes only.

     2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
        Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
        License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
        its terms and conditions.

     3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
        6(a).

     4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
        Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
        all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
        and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
        Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
        authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
        necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
        technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
        Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
        simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4)
        never produces Adapted Material.

     5. Downstream recipients.

        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
           recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives
           an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights
           under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

        b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
           Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically
           receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
           Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the
           conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

        c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
           Material.

     6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
        may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
        are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
        with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
        the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
        provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

     1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
        licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
        privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
        the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
        assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
        extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
        Rights, but not otherwise.

     2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
        Public License.

     3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
        collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
        Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
        under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
        licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
        reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
        the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
        purposes.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

     1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
        form), You must:

        a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
           with the Licensed Material:

           i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
              Material and any others designated to receive
              attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
              Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

          ii. a copyright notice;

         iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

          iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
              warranties;

           v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
              extent reasonably practicable;

        b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain
           an indication of any previous modifications; and

        c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
           Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
           hyperlink to, this Public License.

     2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
        reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
        which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
        reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
        hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
        information.

     3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
        information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
        reasonably practicable.

  b. ShareAlike.

     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

     1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
        license with the same License Elements, this version or
        later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.

     2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
        Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
        in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
        context in which You Share Adapted Material.

     3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
        or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
        Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
        rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     part of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
     only;

  b. if You include all or a substantial part of the database contents
     in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then
     the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights
     (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including
     for purposes of Section 3(b); and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial part of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, ABOUT THE
     LICENSED MATERIAL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES
     OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
     NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
     THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR
     DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN
     FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING
     OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL,
     INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF
     REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS
     OR SERVICES, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS
     NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
     YOU.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most
closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated
     under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

     1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
        it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
        violation; or

     2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect
     any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your
     violations of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License
     is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to
     the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the
     provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this
     Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
     remaining terms and conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and
     immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the
     legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
